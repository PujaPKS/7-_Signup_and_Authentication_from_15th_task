Deliverable [Do it yourself]

When the user is successfully logged In show him the page like this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cza0_sbqMmZ9Beq_pUPpERwH1FQVyVQw/view?usp=sharing.
When the user types the new password, submit the POST request to the url as mentioned here - https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth#section-change-password
The above url take 3 things in the payload --> idToken, newPassword, returnSecureToken(this is always true)
Now try logging in with the old token and it should throw an alert.
